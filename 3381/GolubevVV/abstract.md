Software diganostics can save a significant amount of programmers debug
hours in case itâ€™s detailed and vivid. ROS is a robotics middleware with
mature ecosystem and large amount of debugging utilities. Besides that,
it provides a number of advanced tools for analyzing environment and
individual node state (e.g. *ros\_runtime\_monitor*, *rqt\_console*,
*rosbag*, etc.). But it still lacks a standard system and process
diagnostics tool. This paper attempts to present a reusable solution to
fill this gap and highlight the benefits of such tool for ROS community.
